# 🌐 Nginx Web Server
### Beginner-Friendly Guide for DevOps Engineers and Cloud Engineers

#### ➡️ What is Nginx?
Nginx is high performance web server used to serve the websites and web applications 

## 🧰 Common DevOps Use cases
| Use case | Example |
| :-------- | :------- |
| Web Server     | Serves static and dynamic web content    |
| Reverse Proxy       | Routes client requests to backend servers    |   
| Load Balancer      | Distributes traffic across multiple servers   | 
| API Gateway      | Handles API routing, caching, and rate limiting   |  
| Ingress      | Managing traffic inside Kubernetes clusters   |

## 🛠️ Installation of the Nginx

🐧 On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

📦 On RHEL/CentOS
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```
🐳 On Docker Container

❗ Install the Docker Engine to run the Nginx On Docker 
```bash
docker pull nginx
docker run --name nginx -p 8080:80 -d nginx
```
Visit http://localhost:8080 it will open the default Nginx file in the web browser

# 🌐 Chapter 1: Nginx Web Server

## 🚩 Goal 
Learn how to use the Nginx to serve static content such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Images

## What Is a Web Server?

A web server is software (and sometimes the hardware it runs on) that receives requests from clients (usually web browsers) and delivers web content such as HTML pages, images, CSS, JavaScript, or API responses over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS.

#### Types of Content Served
- Static content: HTML, CSS, images, videos
- Dynamic content: Generated by backend applications (PHP, Node.js, Python, etc.)

## 📁 Default Web configuration path
| File / Directory              | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`       | Default config file server as web browser                          |
| `/var/www/html`               | Default web root directory                             |

## ⚒️ Sample Nginx Web Server Configuration
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
}
```
## Demo: Serve static Website 
1. Create a HTML file:

```bash
touch index.html
echo "<h1>Hello Learners from the created Nginx file</h1>" >> index.html
mv index.html /var/www/html/
```
2. Reload the Nginx

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```
3. Test visit the http://localhotst:8080 or IP of the server with port 8080

## Configuration Explanation

| Directive | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `listen 80` | Listens for HTTP requests |
| `server_name` | Domain or hostname |
| `root` | Website root directory |
| `index` | Default index file |
| `location /` | Request handling block |
| `try_files` | Checks if file exists |

## 🔔 Common HTTP Error Code

## 🤓 Key Learnings

1. Role of a Web Server: Nginx serves web content to users, handles HTTP/HTTPS requests, and can act as a reverse proxy or load balancer.
2. Core Nginx Configuration: The main configuration file (nginx.conf) controls server behavior, virtual hosts, logging, and request handling.
3. HTTP Status Codes Matter: Understanding common HTTP error codes (e.g., 404, 500, 502) helps troubleshoot server and application issues efficiently.
